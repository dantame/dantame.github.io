Over the years I have been lucky to have the opportunity to use many different tools and technologies in my day to day work. For me, this has been hugely important to both my career and continued mental growth. By challenging myself to learn new things I have seen huge leaps in my overall knowledge that I can apply to things that I already know in new and interesting ways that I was previously unaware of.

This blog post will outline some key concepts that work for me when I am learning something new, your mileage may vary! I will be focusing on the idea that you will be learning a new programming language but the concepts can be applied to other fields and topics.

# New does not mean alien

Going in blind to a new tool or technology with no prior knowledge can be very daunting. It is important to realise that most of the topics that you will be teaching yourself are things that you already know about from past experience. The only difference is that they have been created by different people and could be used in slightly different ways. 

### The conceptual toolbox

After being a developer for a few years you have built up a lot of context around the field of programming. You can be reasonably sure if you are learning a new programming language that many of the constructs and tooling that you are used to from your current language will be apparent in some way shape or form in the new language. These are things like:

- Package managers
- Build tools
- Testing libraries
- Linters
- Deployment tools
- Design patterns
- Monitoring tools
- General programming principles
- Project generators / templates
- API docs
- An ecosystem of libraries

This seems really obvious right? It is! Use this knowledge to have a head start in your journey by focusing on how these topics differ from what you are used to, why they differ and how they work. Adding to your toolbox with exposure to new technologies and techniques via Blogs / Lectures / Books is also a great strategy.

### Apply old methods but be open to new idioms

Using your existing knowledge you can get 80% of the way to where you want to be in a new language pretty quickly. The other 20% comes from learning the nuances and idioms of that language. In every language that I have used so far there have been subtle differences that I have picked up and added to my conceptual toolbox. 

New approaches and concepts should make themselves apparent by exposure to the subject. You may encounter a new design pattern or code style that is not common in languages that you are used to. Embrace it and allow these things to guide your learning of the subject by diving deeper into them.

# Focus on your learning style

It is important that you become aware of the most efficient way for you to learn something new. By knowing this key piece of information you will save many hours and a lot of frustration. 

There are many different resources available to learn something dependant on your preferred method.

The different styles of learning generally break down to four methods.

Do you learn by:

- Doing?
- Watching?
- Listening?
- Reading?

For many people it is a combination of the four that yields the best results.

I have found that the most efficient way for me to learn something new is a combination of Doing and Watching.

I like to watch lectures and apply the knowledge that I have gained into something that I build which usually yields more questions for the next round of research.

### Move towards a goal

If you have a clear goal in mind when beginning to learn something it is much easier for you to focus on the topics that are relevant to that and ignore the ones that are not. I generally use a project or an idea for something that I would like to build to drive my learning.

By having a goal it is also much easier to break the topic down into bite size segments that you can tackle one at a time. 

When you reach your goal that doesn't necessarily mean that your learning process has to end, setting a new goal that encompasses different areas of the subject is a good next step.

# Lean on others

It is always better to ask a question and risk appearing stupid than to continue and make a stupid mistake. At some point in time the people that you are asking were in the same position as you! This is very important because no amount of research will ever uncover the lessons that experience teaches. By asking questions of experienced people in the field you are gaining a huge advantage, they will be able to advise you of all the traps that they fell into and how to avoid them.

You may also gain insight into the areas of the subject that are not immediately obvious to you. There could be a whole subset of the topic that you weren't aware of but by talking and asking questions you will be able to look into these new areas.

# Stay curious

This is probably the most important thing in this whole post. I cannot understate how important it is to be curious of new tools, techniques and processes. By keeping up to date in the tech world you are constantly updating your conceptual toolbox with new ideas, staying relevant (and therefor employable) in the industry and you are far better equipped to handle change.

Every new thing learned creates new connections in your brain which can be re-used later and applied to a completely separate subject. You will get faster and faster at picking up new tools and technologies over time by utilising these connections.

I find the best way to stay current with a lot of the new trends in tech is to have a reading list of blogs that you take some time out each day to read. If you don't currently have a list of tech blogs you can start by using [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) as an index and then gradually find the blogs that interest you from there.
